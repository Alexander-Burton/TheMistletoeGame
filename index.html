		We are studying parasitic plants called Mistletoe.
    <p> 
		Mistletoe attach to a host plant and extract water and nutrients from the host in order to survive!
		
	<p>
		Australia has many species of mistletoe. What is unusual is the number of mistletoe that appear to look like their host. We are investigating why this might be.
	<p>	
		In this game you play as a hungry possum that sees a leaf and must decide which group of leaves it belongs to.
	<p>
		The data provided by everybody who plays this game will then be used to assess how Mistletoe's visual similarity to it's host plant relates to the presence of defensive chemicals.
 
      
    <!-- <p class="important">You will be shown pairs of leaves, click the <span class="label">Same</span> button or press the <span class="label">S</span>-key if you think the two leaves shown are from the same plant species or click the <span class="label">Different</span> button or press the <span class="label">D</span>-key if you think the two leaves shown are from different species.
      Hurry, you don't have long to decide!
