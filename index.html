		We are studying parasitic plants called mistletoe.
    <p> 
		Mistletoe attach to a host plant and then extract water and nutrients from the host plant to survive!
		
	<p>
		Many species of mistletoe can be found in Australia and a number of these species appear to look like their host. This resemblance is unusual and is the subject of our research.
	<p>	
		In this game you will be shown leaf silhouettes and then be asked to group a specific leaf with other leaves that you think look most like it.
	<p>
		The data provided by everybody who plays this game will then be used to assess how the visual similarity between different mistletoe species and their hosts relates to the presence of defensive chemicals.
 
      
    <!-- <p class="important">You will be shown pairs of leaves, click the <span class="label">Same</span> button or press the <span class="label">S</span>-key if you think the two leaves shown are from the same plant species or click the <span class="label">Different</span> button or press the <span class="label">D</span>-key if you think the two leaves shown are from different species.
      Hurry, you don't have long to decide!
