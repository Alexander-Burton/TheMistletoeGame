  <p>
If you decide to participate, you will be asked to view standardised images of leaves and
tell us if you think the center leaf belongs to the same species as the leaves on the left or the right side. You will be asked to score a total of 15
images, and the task will take less than 3 minutes. From your responses we will obtain
the frequency with which each pair of leaves are considered to be from the same or different species as well as the time it took
each participant to score each image.
