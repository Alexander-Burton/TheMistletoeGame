    <h1>How To Play:</h1>
	<p>
	<p>
    <p>During each round you will be shown 7 leaf silhouettes like the two above:
	<p> -> Three leaves from one plant species on the left.
	<p> -> Three leaves from a different plant species on the right.
	<p> -> One leaf in the centre.
	<p>
	<p>You will then need to decide whether the centre leaf is from the same plant species as the leaves on the left or the leaves on the right.
	(You won't know which leaves are Mistletoe and which are not)
	
	<p>This game consists of 15 rounds and you will have <font color="red">10 seconds</font> to make your decision during each round.
	
	<p> To make your decision, press the "Left Group" or "Right Group" buttons presented.
	<p> You can also use your keyboard by pressing the Left and Right Keys on your keyboard.
	
	<p>
	<!--<p>It is easy to tell that the leaves in the example above are from different plant species, but it won't always be so easy!-->
